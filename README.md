# IPL Data Analysis Project

This project performs an in-depth data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to clean, process, and visualize IPL match data to uncover actionable insights and trends in team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `IPL_Analysis.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook containing data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.
- `data/matches.csv` â€“ Contains match-level data.
- `data/deliveries.csv` â€“ Contains ball-by-ball delivery data.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## ðŸ§ª Data Preprocessing Steps

- **Handled Missing Values:** Detected and imputed/nullified missing fields to ensure clean analysis.
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment:** Applied boxplots and statistical techniques to identify and mitigate outliers in numerical columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived new insights such as strike rates, economy, win margins, and match impact metrics.
- **Filtered and Merged Datasets:** Combined match and delivery data to enable advanced analysis like player-vs-player performance.
